Log scales:
* decibel
* pH Wert

Logarithms were introduced by John Napier in the early 17th century as a means to simplify calculations. They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, and others to perform computations more easily, using slide rules and logarithm tables. Tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition because of the fact — important in its own right — that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:

$log b ⁡ ( x y ) = log b ⁡ ( x ) + log b ⁡ ( y ) , {\displaystyle \log _{b}(xy)=\log _{b}(x)+\log _{b}(y),\,} \log _{b}(xy)=\log _{b}(x)+\log _{b}(y),\,$

Great post, thanks. Actually economists are very fond of e and ln for lots of reasons, including the ones you mention (we use calculus too) along with others. For example, we like that ln(1+x)=x (approximately, for small x); this is nice for dealing with interest rates. Also (and related), we like that ln differences approximate growth rates.
